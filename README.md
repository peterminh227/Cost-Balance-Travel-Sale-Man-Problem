# Cost Balance Travel Sale Man Problem

The main difference to the original TSP is that edge costs can also be negative and therefore also the cost of a Hamiltonian cycle.
## Methodology

Aside the negative edge costs, we also have infeasible routes in the data. Therefore, I used Guided-Local Search to overcome the infeasiblity solution. Tabu Fast Local Search can help to speed up the algorithm. 

Hybrid Approach: Genetic Algorithm plus Guided Local Search - Fast Local Search
